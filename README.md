# Health-care-Prediction
This project is a healthcare prediction system that leverages machine learning models to predict health-related conditions, including heart disease. The application utilizes four different models to determine the optimal prediction performance, with the Random Forest model achieving 96% accuracy. Built using Python and Streamlit, this project provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for healthcare predictions.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict health conditions accurately using various machine learning models and allow users to interact with the prediction results through an intuitive Streamlit interface. The project includes four machine learning models:

Random Forest Classifier (Optimal model with 96% accuracy)
Decision Tree Classifier
Linear Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The project ultimately selects Random Forest as the optimal model due to its high accuracy in predicting heart disease.

Features
Multi-Model Comparison: Evaluates four different models to determine the best performance.
Heart Disease Prediction: Provides a focused prediction tool for heart disease.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for easy interaction.
Scalable Code Structure: Modular design that can be extended with additional models and datasets.

Models & Methodology
Random Forest: Achieved the highest accuracy (96%) in predicting heart disease. Used as the primary model.
Decision Tree: Simple yet interpretable model.
